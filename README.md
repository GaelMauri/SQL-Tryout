# INTRODUCTION

This repository was done following the course from Luke Barousse, found [here](https://youtu.be/7mz73uXD9DA?si=PoDWVRJG80J5GiFi), as a way to learn the basics and intermediate concepts of SQL, and show my capabilities for managing databases, data manipulation, code optimization and desired outputs. 
This project is structured around 4 questions, each in their own query, that challenge and back up the extent on my knowledge on the tools that helped me complete the tasks in question. 

 

## MATERIAL

### Tools Learned and Used
- **SQL**: the coding language with which the data has been analyzed, allowing to reveal the insights within the data inputted. 
- **CSV Files**: where all the data inputted comes from and, therefore, where all the output source from. The csv files of the "Material" section have been provided by Luke Barousse, while the files in the "Results and Insights" section have been created from the queries. 
- **PostgreSQL**: the relational database management system of my choice, based on the quantity of systems demanded by Data Analyst jobs in Denmark, coming out on top 2 out of the existing database management system, also recommended by the course. Source from [this page](https://datanerd.tech/).
- **VSCode**: my go-to code editor, due to its high customizability, extensions, and language support, boosting my efficiency when running these queries. 
- **GitHub**: in order to store these project, upload the its results, and periodically build a sufficient portfolio, I used GitHub to control the progress and updates of this repository.
